# Course Note

In the first few semesters, the indirect depression, anxiety, and irritability made it difficult to calm down and study. And I feel sorrowful while seeing these subjects (low GPA), so I decide to make a notes collection to review and gain what I missed.

- This is a collection of course notes taken while studying in UofT.
- This is also a practice of GitHub actions and the skill of GitHub page.
  - Notice: Github Page use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) service to convert plain text file into static websites.
  - Change default markdown compile to [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/)
- Most of the mathematic/statistics equation will use latex the `$$` symbol to show up.
- Since design a page will spend lots time, design use jekyll theme [jekyll-TeXt-theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme) from [kitian616](https://github.com/kitian616)

TO-DO LIST FOLLOWING:

- Implement all learned notes

Currently, only few courses' notes available:
- MAT337
- STA302
