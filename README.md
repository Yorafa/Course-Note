# Course-Note
In the first few semesters, the indirect depression, anxiety, and irritability made it difficult to calm down and study. And I feel sorrowful while seeing these subjects (low GPA), so I decide to make a notes collection to review and gain what I missed.

- This is a collection of course notes taken while studying in UofT.
- This is also a practice of GitHub actions and the skill of GitHub page.
    - Notice: Github Page use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) service to convert plain text file into static websites.
    - Change default markdown compile to [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) 
- Most of the mathematic/statistics equation will use latex the `$$` symbol to show up.
    - This site use `Mathjax` to rendering formula
    - If the note need to do rendering equation, add the following html code to do so.
    - e.g. this file can shown formula due to the header code. $1+1\ne 3$


```HTML
<head>
    <script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
        MathJax.Hub.Config({
            tex2jax: {
            skipTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre'],
            inlineMath: [['$','$']]
            }
        });
    </script>
</head>
```

TO-DO LIST FOLLOWING:

- Implement all learned notes

- Write js in each markdown file is too annoying, find a better way to display Latex.

    


Currently, only few courses' notes available:
- STA302
