# Analytic Function & Harmonic Function

## Analytic(Holomorphic) Function

The differentiable complex functions called analytic functions. More details:
- **entire** analytic function: analytic at each point in the entire finite plane
- if function fail to be analytic at some points, those points called **singular points** 
- **meromorphic function**: a function analytic on one of open subset of $D$ except for a set of poles.



## Harmonic Function

The function $U(x,y)$ satisfied **Laplace's equation** $\Delta^2 U = 0$ in a domain $D$ is a **harmonic function** in $D$. More properties:
- $U_{xx}+U_{yy}=0$ implies $U_{xx} = -U_{yy}$
- If a function $V(x,y)$ satisfied **Cauchy-Reimann Equation** $U_x=V_y$ and $U_y = - V_x$ then we call this function $V$ is the **harmonic conjugate function** of function $U$
