# Module 8

In previous module, we talked about the problematic observations. In this module we will focus more about the predictors. We will  look that how the correlated predictors raise issues and some useful numerical measures that can help us to select model.

To the end of this module, we should able to answer following question:
- what are correlated predictors issues
- what is colinearity of a regression model, and how to identify the presence of collinearity
- how to compute various measure of fit related and how to use those to select a better model
-
