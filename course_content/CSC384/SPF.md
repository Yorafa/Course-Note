# Search Problems: Formalization

FFT(Fast Fourier Theorem) Algorithm use to contribute the sound.



## The Components of a Search Problem 

Beyond the search problem, we define a game has properties followed:

1.   Set: a list of objects
2.   State: the situation
3.   Cost
4.   Benefit
5.   Path: sequence of state and action

For search problem:

-   1 player

How to end a search problem:

1.   check the state if the goal then end3
2.   perform action
3.   set state and go to 1
